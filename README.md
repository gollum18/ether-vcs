# ether-vcs
A DAG VCS built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

## What is this?
Yet another idea I had to continue working with smart contracts on top of the Ethereum platform. The goal is to implement a 100% purely smart contract driven approach to version control in order to build a distributed data store on top of the Ethereum blockchain platform. This project attempts to implement TDD as much as possible.

This is very much a WIP and is still in the conceptual stage at this point in time.

## Project Milestones
1. Determine system requirements and rank them in order of importance
2. Design a set of core user stories
3. Derive test cases from user stories and rank them in order of relevance to system requirement rankings
4. Design contracts in a way that they satisfy all core test cases
5. Implement contracts using incremental development, only moving to the next increment when all core test cases for the increment are satisfied
